Little system that will (who knows) almost (or not) predict the lottery numbers. ðŸ˜‚

This was created to play around with statistics in a time I was starting to learn about ML. Very fun to do and learned EDA by coding functions for cleaning and processing data. Unfortunately no, machine learning cannot be used to predict lottery numbers, as this would imply 100% accuracy and a probabilistic model would fit this perfectly, i.e. it wouldn't be needed since a mathematical function would be obvious. Nevertheless, numbers do follow some pattern around the normal distribution and it's very fun to play with luck.

I've uploaded a notebook in Python just for some brief analysis. In this I've just put together a LSTM NN along with aprox. 2000 lottery registers for prediction. Feature extraction doesn't seem to improve overall accuracy as well, so this is really just for fun.

For the future I intend to test some linear regression in each number position. Who knows, right? ðŸ˜›
